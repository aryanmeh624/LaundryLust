LaundryLust is a smart laundry management app designed for university students living in hostels. It helps track the cleanliness of your clothes and alerts you when it's time to wash them. 🧼✨ This way, you avoid the common problem of wearing smelly clothes because you forgot how dirty they are.

## ✨ Features

- **🧥 Track Clothes Cleanliness**: Monitor the dirtiness level of each piece of clothing.
- **📢 Wear or Wash Alerts**: Get notified when a piece of clothing has reached the point where it should be washed.
- **🚨 Washing Machine Alerts**: When multiple clothes are classified as "to be washed," the app will remind you to start the washing machine.
- **🖼️ User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive UI designed to make laundry management hassle-free.

## 🚀 Future Plans

In future updates, LaundryLust will include a community feature for students in the same college. This feature will:
- **🌐 Community Alerts**: Notify students based on the availability of drying lines in the hostel, helping everyone plan their laundry more efficiently.

## 🎯 Target Audience

This app is ideal for university students, especially those living in hostels, who often struggle to keep track of their laundry. 🏫 It ensures you always have fresh clothes to wear and helps maintain hygiene.
